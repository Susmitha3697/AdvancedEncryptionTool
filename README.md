**DESCRIPTION**:                                                                                                                                                                
🔒➡️🛡️💻: Build a secure 🛡️ & user-friendly 😊 tool to encrypt 🤫 & decrypt 🔓 files using advanced algorithms like AES-256! 💪

We'll use PyCryptodome 🐍 for strong crypto!

Key Steps:

**1.** User Interface: Easy file selection 📂 & password input 🔑 (masked!).                                                                                                 
**2.** Key Derivation: Use PBKDF2 🧂 to create strong keys from passwords.                                                                                                    
**3.** AES-256 Encryption: Securely scramble file content using AES-256 in a safe mode (like CBC with IV 💉 or GCM with integrity check ✅). Save as a new file (.enc?).     
**4.** AES-256 Decryption: Select encrypted file, enter password, derive key, and restore original content 📄. Save as a new file.                                            
**5.** Robustness: Handle errors (wrong password ❌, file issues) with clear messages. Efficient for different file sizes.                                                    
**6.** Deliverable: A robust encryption application ⚙️ with a user-friendly interface 🖱️, powered by PyCryptodome for strong security! ✨
